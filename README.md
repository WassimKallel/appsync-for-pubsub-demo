# Multiplayer Counter Pub Sub Demo

This is a simple project to showcase how you can use an AWS AppSync Local Resolver (also known as a NONE Data Source type) to get simple broadcast pub/sub over websockets. The client code is built in React.

## How to run the demo

Assuming you've already instaled and configured the AWS Amplify CLI, try this:

```
amplify init --app https://github.com/gabehollombe-aws/appsync-for-pubsub-demo
```
